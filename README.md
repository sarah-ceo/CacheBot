# CacheBot
This is a school project: an ARM assembly program to simulate a simplified version of the game "hide-and-seek" between two Evalbots. 
One robot goes to a predefined position, and the other one explores the area until it finds it. 

More details about the project can be found in [this file](Rapport-Projet-NÂ°10_3I-IN1.pdf) (in French) and a small demonstration can be found [here](Cache-cache.mp4). 

This project was made with Pierre PERRIER-RIDET (pierre.perrierridet@gmail.com).
